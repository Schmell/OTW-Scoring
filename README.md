# On The Water Scoring

This is a sail sport scoring application not unlike Sailwave, just more modern and hosted to avoid the need for dedicated software and to be able to share real-time data with the user base.

## Try it out!

Currently there is a development deployment. As it is still in development i would prefer not to just share the link publicly as i do not want a bad actor to spam the server and run up a tab on me.
If you would like to try it out just send me a DM

### Build it yourself

This is a firebase app so you will need a firebase account and be familiar with how to get a firestore and authentication server set up with firebase.
you can find the firebase init file under utils in the src directory.
Clone and install.
You will need to run firebase init after install to connect your repo to firebase which will create github workflow actions for deployment
Again you should probably be familiar with the firebase and it will be easy.
